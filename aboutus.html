            We also seek to ensure fair and unbiased legal protection for parents of both sexes. Violence is a learned behavior facilitated by lack of awareness. Consequently, Hope For Children educates the general public, families, federal and state law-enforcement officials, members of the judiciary, prosecutors, educators, medical professionals, criminal justice professionals, family shelters, rape crisis centers, other community organizations and agencies, clergy, school and church administrators, the workplace and other leaders in the community about sexual and physical abuse and its prevention.

            <h3>Living an abuse free life is more than a hope or a dream</h3> <br>
            <p>
            By working together, the prospect of precious children in Texas and cross the nation living abuse-free lives can be realized. To this end, Hope For Children assembled a distinguished group of experts to provide Texans with uniform state and federal training. This statewide training project was partially funded through a grant provided by the United States Department of Justice, Violence Against Women Fund, Office of the Texas Governor Criminal Justice Division. The training program was very well received as reflected in evaluation comments.
